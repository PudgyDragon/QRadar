Login to console CLI as root
Backup the content_package table with:
mkdir -p /store/IBM_Support/
pg_dump -U qradar -t content_package -inserts -f /store/IBM_Support/content_package.sql-$(date+%F)

Run psql command to determine ID
psql -U qradar -c “select hub_id, content_status, id from content_package where content_status not in (3,6,9);”

Update content_package table and set conflicting IDs in the content_status column to 6 (uninstalled status):
psql -U qradar -c “update content_package set content_status = 6 where id=’<ID>’;”

Rerun psql command to ensure there's no output:
psql -U qradar -c “select hub_id, content_status, id from content_package where content_status not in (3,6,9);”
